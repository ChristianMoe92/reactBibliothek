# reactBibliothek
A little example for a ReactJS-App calling a self-made REST API

Inspired by an Example for a Web-Dynpro in SAP ABAP.

The App is split in three parts: 

The Database \
The REST-API \
The Frontend \

The Database is made with MariaDB and can be set up with the SQL Script in the folder "examplaDatabase".

The REST-API is written in PHP and must be executed via an Apache Server (Port 80). For Xampp just put the folder "bibVerw" into Xampp's htdocs-directory

For the Frontend made with Primefaces for React.js (PrimeReact) please follow the instructions in the ReadMe-file.
